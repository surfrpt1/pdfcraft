> **📱 iPad/iPhone build (community experiment, this fork only):** sideloadable IPAs with a native Files picker, bundled OCR models, app icon and touch-tuned panning — see [iOS (iPad) sideload builds](#ios-ipad-sideload-builds) and the [releases page](../../releases). Not affiliated with the ArtCraft team.

## iOS (iPad) sideload builds

> Unofficial community experiment, built from upstream plus an iOS porting
> spike (`spike/ios/`, `ios-spike`/`ios-ipa` workflows). If the ArtCraft team
> ships official iOS support, use that instead.

- **Download:** [releases](../../releases) (`PdfCraft-ios-*.ipa`, newest first).
- **Install:** sideload with AltStore/Sideloadly using your Apple ID (free
  7-day certificate). Bundle ID: `com.surfrpt1.pdfcraft`. Tested on iPad Air 5
  via LiveContainer.
- **Works:** full app, native Files import picker, folder/save pickers, OCR
  (models bundled), saves visible in the Files app, app icon, 1.3× touch pan
  with momentum.
- **Known spike limitations:** file dialogs are bridged natively but folder
  access claims are held for the session; debug (not release) builds, so
  slower than a final build would be; upstream updates need re-porting.

### How the port works (for the curious)

Upstream compiles for `aarch64-apple-ios` except two crates: `rfd` (file
dialogs — no iOS backend, stubbed with a `UIDocumentPickerViewController`
bridge in `spike/ios/rfd-stub/`) and `glutin` (pulled in by eframe's `glow`
fallback — dropped for iOS targets, Metal only). Linking needs an iOS 17+
deployment target; the IPA is packaged on a GitHub mac runner.

## Read anything, beautifully

PdfCraft renders PDFs with care for the details that make a page feel right: kerning and ligatures, right-to-left and complex scripts, vertical CJK, colour emoji, shadings, blend modes, soft masks and optional content.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-scripts.png" alt="The Scripts of the World page: Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, Thai, Greek, Cyrillic, Chinese, Korean, IPA, Armenian, Georgian and Tamil samples, with vertical Japanese in the right margin" width="100%">
  <br>
  <sub>Twelve writing systems on one page, plus vertical Japanese, at 125%.</sub>
</p>

- **Deep zoom stays sharp.** Large pages render in tiles, so text stays crisp at any magnification.
- **Built to survive bad files.** Every page renders in isolation and damaged documents are repaired. Across the 983-file pdf.js test corpus the result is 0 crashes.
- **Layouts for every task:** continuous, single page, two-up, view rotation, full screen and a distraction-free Read mode.
- **Light and dark themes**, both designed to be easy on the eyes for long sessions.

<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-twoup.png" alt="Two facing pages in Read mode with the dark theme: the Foreword and the Setting Text chapter with its drop cap and pull quote"></td>

</tr>
</table>

## Find it, select it, copy it

Search the whole document as you type, step through matches with <kbd>⌘G</kbd>, and select text that comes out in the right reading order. That holds for columns, right-to-left runs and CJK too.

## Navigate long documents

Bookmarks, page thumbnails and the document's own page labels (i, ii, 1, 2…) keep you oriented in long documents. Search bookmark titles in the Bookmarks panel to find nested entries even when their parents are collapsed. Matches keep their ancestors for context; Clear restores the unfiltered tree without changing its expansion state.

</tr>
</table>

---

## Organize pages like cards on a table

Open **Organize pages** to see every page at once:
- **Select pages:** click, <kbd>⌘</kbd>-click or <kbd>⇧</kbd>-click.
- **Change them:** rotate, delete, insert blank pages, insert pages from another file, and move them earlier or later.
- **Undo anything:** <kbd>⌘Z</kbd>, then save.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-organize.png" alt="The Organize pages grid with the showcase's pages as thumbnails, three of them selected, and the page toolbar above" width="100%">
  <br>
  <sub>Organize pages with three pages selected and the page tools in the toolbar above.</sub>
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Undo that goes the distance.** Each change is one step in a history you can walk backwards and forwards. The Edit menu names the step ("Undo Rotate pages"), and undo still works after you save.

**Saves you can trust:**
- *Incremental:* the original bytes stay byte-for-byte intact.
- *Atomic:* the file is written to a temporary copy, then swapped in.
- *Verified:* independently checked with qpdf.

When open documents exceed the window width, scroll over the tab strip with the mouse wheel or trackpad, or use its horizontal scrollbar. Opening or switching to a document brings its tab into view.

Unsaved documents carry a dot on their tab, and closing or quitting asks before anything is lost. Changes are autosaved every minute. If PdfCraft ever quits unexpectedly, it offers to recover your work the next time it opens. Encrypted documents stay encrypted on disk.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-split.png" alt="The Split document dialog over the organize view, set to one page per file and reporting that it creates 13 files from 13 pages"><br><sub>Split document: one page per file makes 13 files.</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>

## Combine and split without losing a thing

**Combine files** merges any number of PDFs into one. Each file gets a bookmark, with its own bookmarks nested underneath.

**Extract** copies the pages you select into a new document. **Split** divides a document every *n* pages, or before the pages you choose.

Nothing quietly disappears along the way:
- links and named destinations are rewired to the copied pages;
- form fields stay interactive;
- layers keep their on/off defaults;
- attachments come along.

Every page of a combined document renders pixel-identical to its source.

```sh
pdfcraft-cli combine report.pdf appendix.pdf --out combined.pdf
pdfcraft-cli extract report.pdf --pages 1,3,5 --out highlights.pdf
pdfcraft-cli split   report.pdf --every 10 --out-dir parts/
```

---

## Open protected documents and respect their rules

PdfCraft implements the PDF standard security handler completely:
- every revision, from 40-bit RC4 to AES-256;
- user and owner passwords, including Unicode passwords normalised with SASLprep;
- crypt filters and attachment-only encryption.

Documents restricted by their author show a clear notice, and PdfCraft honours their permissions. Enter the owner password and the restrictions lift. Edits to encrypted documents are saved encrypted, under the same keys.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><img src="docs/images/pdfcraft-properties.png" alt="The Document Properties dialog on its Description tab, with editable title, author, subject and keywords, and tabs for Security, Fonts and Advanced"><br><sub>Document Properties, Description tab</sub></td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Document Properties** shows:
- the document's title, author, subject and keywords, which you can edit;
- the fonts it uses and whether each is embedded;
- PDF version, page size, tags, fields, layers and attachments;
- the full security picture: encryption method, which password opened it, and each permission.

## Runs everywhere, stays yours

- **Native on macOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD**, and **in the browser** through WebAssembly, from the same Rust codebase. Windows builds come for x64, x86 and ARM64 (Windows on ARM, no emulation); every ARM64 change is tested on ARM64 hardware in CI.
- **Private by design.** Documents never leave your machine. There's no account, no telemetry and no cloud processing.
- **Engine first.** Parsing, rendering and editing live in reusable library crates. The interface is one swappable layer on top.
- **Scriptable.** The `pdfcraft-cli` tool (see [Built for agents, too](#built-for-agents-too)) covers inspecting, rendering, extracting text, editing, combining, extracting pages and splitting. Robustness sweeps run on the same engine as the app.

```sh
pdfcraft-cli info  form.pdf                                  # structure as JSON
pdfcraft-cli text  paper.pdf --page 3                        # reading-order text
pdfcraft-cli edit  in.pdf --rotate 1,2:90 --delete 5 --title "Q3" --out out.pdf
```

---

## Built for agents, too

Every engine feature is reachable without the GUI, through one table of JSON-Schema-described tools: open, inspect, render pages to PNG, extract and find text, rotate, delete, move and insert pages, edit bookmarks and page labels, add, reply to, restyle and delete comments (highlight a phrase just by naming it), list and fill in form fields, protect with passwords, set metadata, undo and redo, save, combine, extract and split. Three front doors share it:

- **`pdfcraft-cli run`**, for one-off calls and JSON scripts:

  ```sh
  pdfcraft-cli tools                                        # every tool and its JSON Schema
  pdfcraft-cli run text_find doc=1 query=invoice            # key=value; values parse as JSON
  pdfcraft-cli run --script review.json                     # e.g. comment_add {"type": "highlight", "find": "total due"}
  pdfcraft-cli run --script steps.json --root ./work        # several steps in one session
  ```

  With `--root`, every file the script's steps read or write stays in that directory, including the PNG a step saves with `"out"` (the script itself is read from wherever you name it).

- **An MCP server**, for AI agents such as Claude. **It is opt-in:** PdfCraft never starts it on its own, and it opens no network port. It runs only while an agent launches `pdfcraft-cli mcp`, talks over stdin/stdout, and stops when the agent disconnects. To enable it, add it to your agent's MCP configuration:

  ```json
  { "mcpServers": { "pdfcraft": { "command": "pdfcraft-cli", "args": ["mcp", "--root", "/path/to/your/pdfs"] } } }
  ```

  `--compact` shrinks the tool list the agent has to read: `tools/list` returns about ten core tools plus `tool_search` and `tool_call`, which find and run every other tool, so the list costs far fewer tokens. Every tool still works.

  `--root` confines every file the agent can read or write to one directory. Builds that should not include the server at all can use `cargo build -p pdfcraft-cli --no-default-features`.

- **The Rust API** (`pdfcraft_automation::Automation::call`), for embedding.

Edits stay in memory, undoable, until `doc_save`. Saving to the same file appends an incremental update, so the original bytes are preserved, and the write is atomic. Unsaved changes are never discarded silently.

### Driving the app itself

Start the desktop app with `pdfcraft --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json` and an agent can see and operate the real interface: the widget tree with labels and positions (from the accessibility tree), clicks, typing, keys, commands, view options and screenshots. This is also off by default. It listens only on loopback, and every connection must present the random token written to that file, which only you can read.

Keep the control file in a folder only you can write, not a shared one such as `/tmp`: another user could create the file there first and receive your commands. `pdfcraft-cli ui` refuses a control file that is a symbolic link, and on macOS, Linux and FreeBSD one that another user owns or can read or write. The app doesn't start if it can't write the file.

```sh
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json inspect query=rotate      # find widgets
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json click label="Organize pages"
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json key key=K modifiers='["command"]'
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json command id=comment.square   # pick a tool, then draw:
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json drag from='[400,300]' to='[600,420]'
pdfcraft-cli ui --control ~/.pdfcraft-control.json screenshot --out window.png
```

---

## How it's built

PdfCraft is a Cargo workspace of focused crates, layered so the core never depends on the UI:

| Crate | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pdfcraft-filters` | Every PDF stream filter (Flate, LZW, ASCII85, RunLength, predictors), encode and decode, property-tested |
| `pdfcraft-crypt` | The standard security handler: RC4, AES-128/256, revisions 2–6, permissions |
| `pdfcraft-cos` | The PDF object layer: tolerant parsing, repair, copy-on-write edits, incremental and full writing |
| `pdfcraft-organize` | Page operations, combine / extract / split, bookmarks, page labels, document information |
| `pdfcraft-fonts` | Font metrics and encodings for generated appearances |
| `pdfcraft-annot` | Comments: builders and appearance streams for notes, text markup, shapes, ink and text boxes; replies, status, edits |
| `pdfcraft-forms` | Interactive forms: the field model, filling with regenerated appearances, Clear form |
| `pdfcraft-render` | Rendering, inspection and text extraction with reading order |
| `pdfcraft-engine` | The façade every frontend uses: sessions, edits, undo, saving, the tool catalogue |
| `pdfcraft-automation` | Agent control: the headless tool table, `pdfcraft-cli run`, and the opt-in MCP server |
| `pdfcraft-ui-egui` | The desktop and web interface |

**Quality gates.** Every change passes the same automated checks:
- formatting, and Clippy with warnings as errors;
- 200+ unit, property and UI tests;
- crate-layering rules and a WebAssembly build check;
- an asset-licence audit.

On top of those, two corpus sweeps run over real-world files:
- **Opening and rendering:** of the 983 pdf.js test files, 963 open and render cleanly, with 0 crashes.
- **Open, edit and save round trips:** 958 succeed.

The output is verified with independent tools: hayro, qpdf and poppler.

PdfCraft is a clean-room implementation. Its behaviour comes from the ISO 32000 specification and black-box observation, never from anyone else's code. Every icon, font and image is openly licensed and listed in [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Get started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft
cd pdfcraft
cargo run --release -p pdfcraft -- some.pdf     # desktop app
cargo xtask demo-pdf                              # build the showcase PDF used in these screenshots
cargo xtask screenshots                           # regenerate every screenshot in this README
```

The interface language is chosen in **Menu → Edit → Preferences…** (Command-comma on macOS,
Ctrl-comma elsewhere, also with no document open; Auto follows the system language;
see [docs/localization.md](docs/localization.md)) and saved. Japanese covers commands,
dialogs, panels and keyboard shortcuts. Command search accepts the translated label, the
English label and the stable command id; filenames, PDF contents, author names, custom
action names and error details from the engine or the operating system keep their own text.

Japanese fonts come from [craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), an optional build
input that every release includes. To build with them (Japanese interface text, and Japanese text in
edited PDFs):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts ../craft-fonts
CRAFT_FONTS_DIR=../craft-fonts cargo run --release -p pdfcraft -- some.pdf
```

Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft/releases) has ready-made builds for macOS,
Windows, Linux (AppImage, Flatpak, `.deb`, `.rpm` and a tarball), FreeBSD and the web; see
[Downloads](#downloads). On Gentoo, the community [::snakebyte
overlay](https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay) packages the Linux release as
`app-text/pdfcraft-bin` (not maintained by the PdfCraft team):

```sh
eselect repository add snakebyte git https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay.git
emaint sync -r snakebyte
echo 'app-text/pdfcraft-bin ~amd64' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/pdfcraft
emerge --ask app-text/pdfcraft-bin
```

Logs, environment variables and other development notes are in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## What's next

PdfCraft is young and moving fast. The aim is a workbench where you can view, organize, annotate, fill, sign and edit PDFs, at parity with Acrobat Pro.

**Where it stands (October 2026), honestly:** about half of Acrobat Pro's offline features are in (88% of the must-haves), but that is roughly a third of the work, because the hardest parts are still ahead.

- **Good today:** viewing and search; organizing, combining and splitting; most kinds of comment; filling and authoring forms (with sandboxed JavaScript); passwords, redaction and sanitizing; basic digital signatures; printing; the Accessibility Checker; agent control through the CLI and MCP.
- **Still borrowed:** pages are drawn by the `hayro` crate while our own renderer is built.
- **Thin or missing:** reliable editing of existing text (especially CJK), OCR beyond Latin script, Office import/export, signature timestamps and long-term validation, PDF/A/X/UA preflight, XFA forms and localization.
- **Hardening:** fuzzing still turns up crashes and hangs on hostile files; each one is fixed with a regression test. Quality has not yet been compared with Acrobat side by side.

**Next, in order:** our own renderer, hardening and a fidelity harness against Acrobat, editing existing content, then the Pro workflows (signatures, OCR, Office, preflight, XFA) and 1.0 polish.

The honest assessment by area, what's lacking and where we're going are in **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#honest-assessment-2026-10-05)**, with the full plan, progress and estimates.

## Downloads

**New to PdfCraft?** Download it from the [PdfCraft page on getartcraft.com](https://getartcraft.com/apps/pdfcraft). That's the easiest way to install it.

**Want a specific build or format?** On GitHub, the [latest release](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft/releases/latest) has every build listed below, and [all releases](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `pdfcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `pdfcraft-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `pdfcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `pdfcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `pdfcraft-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `pdfcraft-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed.

The portable zip runs from any folder, a USB stick included. Its `portable.txt` keeps the settings,
logs and crash recovery in a `PdfCraftData` folder next to `pdfcraft.exe`, so nothing is written to
`%APPDATA%`; delete that file to use the normal per-user folders.

The MSI installs for all users and requires administrator privileges. For unattended deployment
without a desktop shortcut, run from an elevated terminal:

```powershell
msiexec /i "pdfcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi" /qn /norestart INSTALLDESKTOPSHORTCUT=0
```

Use the MSI for your architecture. Per-user installation overrides are not supported.

### macOS

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App, universal (Apple silicon + Intel) | `pdfcraft-<ver>-macos-universal.dmg` | Signed and notarized |
| Command-line tool, universal | `pdfcraft-cli-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` | Signed and notarized |

### Linux

| Format | x86_64 | aarch64 (ARM64) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AppImage | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.AppImage` | Runs anywhere; updates itself with [AppImageUpdate](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate) (`.zsync` files) |
| Flatpak | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.flatpak` | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.flatpak` | Sandboxed; `flatpak install --user <file>` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb` | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.deb` | |
| Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.rpm` | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.rpm` | |
| Tarball | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `pdfcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` | Unpack anywhere |
| Command-line tool | `pdfcraft-cli-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `pdfcraft-cli-<ver>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` | `pdfcraft-cli` alone (and its opt-in MCP server), for servers, CI and agents |

Every Linux build needs glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+, RHEL 10).

### FreeBSD

| Build | File |
|---|---|
| x86_64 | `pdfcraft-<ver>-freebsd-x86_64.tar.gz` |

stand on its own.
